'''
Module: CaptureThread.py
Purpose: a thread class intended for retrieving frame data constantly from a Video device(webcam),
         and adding that frame data to a queue that is then passed to ImageProcessThread.
Depends On: threading, cv2(OpenCV)

                by specifying the Capture device number through imageCam, the width and height of
                the image(resolution), and the amount of frames per second desired.
