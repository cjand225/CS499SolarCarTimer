<h1>User manual</h1>

<h2>Running the program</h2>

<p>After installing the <code>conda</code> environment, it will be necessary to activate the environment before running.
</p>

<h3>On Windows</h3>

<p>From a Command Prompt (or Anaconda's "Anaconda Prompt"), run</p>

<pre><code>activate "timer-utility"
</code></pre>

<h3>On macOS and Linux</h3>

<p>From a terminal, run</p>

<pre><code>source activate "timer-utility"
</code></pre>

<p>Once the environment has been activated, the program may be run using <code>python</code> from the root directory of
    the repository. Depending on your system, the command may look like one of the following:</p>

<pre><code>python3 -m src.main
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>python -m src.main
</code></pre>

<h2>Using the program</h2>

<p>Once the program starts, a GUI similar to the one below should appear.</p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/gui_screen1.png" alt="Initial GUI" title=""/></p>

<p>From this screen, existing data may be loaded from the <strong>File</strong> menu.</p>

<p>Currently, the <strong>Open</strong>, <strong>Save</strong>, and <strong>Save as</strong> actions work correctly and
    can be used to save or load lap data files in a CSV format.</p>

<h3>Adding cars to the table</h3>

<p>Upon opening the application, it may become apparent that no cells in the Lap Table can be editted immediately. This
    is intentional; before any lap data can be entered, the cars to be tracked must first be added to the table.</p>

<p>A car may be added to the table through the <strong>Edit</strong> menu by selecting <strong>Edit</strong> > <strong>Add
    Car</strong>. This action will display a dialog prompting for information about the car to be added.</p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/gui_screen2.png" alt="Car dialog" title=""/></p>

<p>Once a car is added, the Team name associated with the car will appear in the header of one of the columns. At that
    point, lap data may be entered into the column using one of the methods described in <strong>Adding and editing lap
        data</strong> below.</p>

<p>Cars may also be added without the menu. Double clicking any cell in the leftmost column unassigned to a car will
    produce the same <strong>Add Car</strong> dialog accessible from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu.</p>

<h3>Adding and editing lap data</h3>

<p>Two working methods are currently available for inputting lap data. Both methods should be usable simultaneously; the
    application is not limited to using one method at a time.</p>

<h4>Manual lap entry</h4>

<p>The simplest way of entering lap data is by entering the elapsed times directly into the table. All filled rows in a
    column are editable. This allows changing of previously entered lap times.</p>

<p>Additionally, the cell immediately below the last filled cell in a column is editable. This allows appending of a new
    lap time for a car. If no lap times appear in the column, the first cell the column will be editable.</p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/gui_screen3.png" alt="Appending lap time" title=""/></p>

<p>The lap times entered into the cells in the table are expected to be in the format <code>%H:%M:%S.%m</code>, where
    <code>%H</code> represents the number of hours, <code>%M</code> represents the number of minutes, <code>%S</code>
    represents the number of seconds, and <code>%m</code> represents the number of milliseconds. The milliseconds,
    hours, and minutes are optional, so the time entered may be given in the format, <code>%M:%S</code>, for example.
</p>

<h4>Semi-automatic lap entry</h4>

<p>Laps may also be entered into the table semi-automatically through the use of buttons which simply record the latest
    lap time based on previous times in the table.</p>

<p>The Semi-Automatic mode may be accessed by opening <strong>Semi-Auto</strong> through the <strong>View</strong> menu.
</p>

<p>As cars are added to the table, buttons corresponding to each team are added to the Semi-automatic mode window.</p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/gui_screen4.png" alt="Semi-auto mode" title=""/></p>

<p>To begin recording times for car using the Semi-automatic mode, click the <strong>Start</strong> button for the car.
    This will begin the first lap for the car. Once the lap has been completed, clicking <strong>Record time</strong>
    will add the elapsed time to the table and begin the next lap for the car.</p>
